# Focus

The priority of the week. **One.** It gets done, no excuses.

One file per ISO week, `YYYY_W<week>.md`:

```text
docs/focus/2026_W37.md
```

This folder is singular on purpose. `priorities` in the plural invites you to put
three in, and three priorities are zero priorities: that is exactly the mechanism
by which a lot gets prioritised and nothing gets executed.

## The four rules

### 1. One priority, and it is an outcome, not an activity

"Refactor the chat" is not a priority, it is an activity — it has no way of
ending. "The chat loads a conversation in under 300 ms" does: it can be measured,
and on Friday you know whether it happened.

### 2. If it does not fit in the week, what goes in is its first slice

Before writing it down, split the priority into actions that finish **in a day**.
If you cannot split it, you do not understand it yet — and then the priority of
the week is to understand it: "investigate X for 1 hour, come back with actions".

Procrastinating what matters is almost never laziness. It is ambiguity.

### 3. A dependency does not postpone, it becomes an action

Writing "blocked by" is forbidden. If something depends on a third party, another
repo or a decision, the action is **the move that unblocks it**, with an owner and
a day: send the email, open the PR in the other repo, request the access.

If waiting really is the only thing possible, then it was not the priority of the
week. Pick another one.

### 4. The week closes with the real outcome

On Friday you write **Done: yes / no** and why. You do not rewrite the priority to
match what happened, and you do not silently drag it into next week: if it is
still alive, you pick it again on purpose and say it is the second time.

A file that never says "no" is not measuring anything.

## No tables

Neither here nor in the weekly files. This is filled in by a person, every Monday, by
hand — and a markdown table with its pipes is a punishment to write and impossible to
keep aligned. Lists, always. If something needs three fields, it is a bullet with three
sub-bullets, not a row.

## What does NOT go here

- Ideas and everything missing → `../BACKLOG.md`
- Live bugs → `../known_issues/`
- What already shipped → `../shipped/`
